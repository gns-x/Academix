## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get AcademiX up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   PostgreSQL server running

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install # or yarn install

# Copy environment variables file
cp .env.example .env

# --- Configure your .env file now ---
# Update DATABASE_URL with your PostgreSQL connection string
# Generate a strong JWT_SECRET (e.g., using `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)

# Generate Prisma client and run migrations
npm run prisma:generate # or yarn prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate dev # or yarn prisma:migrate dev
# NOTE: `dev` is for development; adjust for production setup if needed.

# Start the backend server in development mode
npm run start:dev # or yarn start:dev
```
The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the PORT specified in your `.env`).

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install # or yarn install

# Copy environment variables file
cp .env.example .env

# --- Configure your .env file now ---
# Update VITE_API_URL to point to your backend (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
# Configure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY if using Supabase realtime features

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```
The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated by your vite server).

---

## üîß Configuration

Environment variables are crucial for configuring AcademiX. Refer to the `.env.example` files in both `backend` and `frontend` directories.

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)
```env
NODE_ENV=development # or production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/academix?schema=public" # Ensure schema is correct
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key_replace_me" # **CRITICAL: Replace with a strong unique secret**
# Optional: Add configurations for email services, file storage, etc.
```

#### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)
```env
NODE_ENV=development # or production
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api" # Ensure this matches your backend API endpoint
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL" # Required if using Supabase realtime
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY" # Required if using Supabase realtime
# Optional: Add configurations for feature flags, external service keys, etc.
```

## üìä Database Schema Overview

AcademiX utilizes a well-structured relational database design centered around core educational entities. The schema includes tables for:

*   `Student`: Core student information, linking to academics, finances, family, etc.
*   `Teacher`: Staff profiles, qualifications, and assignments.
*   `Guardian`: Parent/Guardian information and relationships to students.
*   `Family`: Groups guardians and their related students.
*   `Course`/`Subject`: Defines academic offerings.
*   `Class`: Instances of courses for specific groups of students.
*   `Enrollment`: Links students to classes and services.
*   `Service`: Definitions of non-academic services (transport, clubs, etc.).
*   `FeeType`/`FeeAssignment`: Defines and assigns fees.
*   `Invoice`/`Payment`/`Transaction`: Handles financial tracking and processing.
*   `AttendanceRecord`: Logs student attendance.
*   `Grade`/`AcademicRecord`: Stores student performance data.
*   `User`: Authentication layer, linked to roles (Admin, Teacher, Guardian, etc.).

*(Suggestion: Consider adding a link to a database schema diagram or generating one and including it here later!)*

## üîê Security Measures

Security is a top priority for AcademiX, implementing multiple layers of protection:

*   **JWT Authentication:** Securely verifies user identity for API access.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensures users only access resources permitted by their role (e.g., teachers see their students, guardians see their children).
*   **Password Hashing:** User passwords are encrypted using strong, industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt).
*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Prevents injection attacks by cleaning and validating all user input.
*   **CORS Protection:** Configured to restrict access from unauthorized domains.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protects against brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
*   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Achieved by using Prisma ORM, which automatically parametrizes queries.

## üöÄ Deployment

Deploying AcademiX involves building both the frontend and backend applications.

### Backend Deployment
1.  Build the production-ready backend code:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run build # or yarn build
    ```
2.  Ensure your production `.env` file is correctly configured (especially `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `NODE_ENV=production`).
3.  Start the production server. This typically involves using a process manager like PM2 or deploying to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean) that runs the build output:
    ```bash
    npm run start:prod # or yarn start:prod
    ```
    This command runs `node dist/main.js`.

### Frontend Deployment
1.  Build the production-ready frontend code:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build # or yarn build
    ```
2.  This command creates a `dist` folder in your `frontend` directory containing the static production files.
3.  Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3). Ensure your hosting is configured for a Single Page Application (SPA), redirecting all traffic to `index.html`. Make sure the `VITE_API_URL` and Supabase variables in the frontend `.env` are set for your *production* backend and Supabase instances.
